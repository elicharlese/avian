        <p>
          This Cookie Policy explains how AVIAN ("we", "us", or "our") uses cookies and similar technologies on our

        <p>
          Cookies are small text files that are stored on your device (computer, tablet, or mobile) when you visit a

        <p>
          Cookies can be "persistent" or "session" cookies. Persistent cookies remain on your device when you go

        <h2 className="mt-8 text-xl font-semibold">3. How We Use Cookies</h2>
        <p>We use cookies for several purposes:</p>
        <ul className="list-disc pl-6">
          <li>
            <strong>Essential Cookies:</strong> These cookies are necessary for the website to function properly. They
            enable core functionality such as security, network management, and account access. You may disable these by
            changing your browser settings, but this may affect how the website functions.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Analytical/Performance Cookies:</strong> These cookies allow us to recognize and count the number of
            visitors and see how visitors move around our website. This helps us improve the way our website works, for
            example, by ensuring that users find what they are looking for easily.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Functionality Cookies:</strong> These cookies are used to recognize you when you return to our
            website. This enables us to personalize our content for you, greet you by name, and remember your
            preferences (for example, your choice of language or region).
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Targeting Cookies:</strong> These cookies record your visit to our website, the pages you have
            visited, and the links you have followed. We use this information to make our website and the advertising
            displayed on it more relevant to your interests.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2 className="mt-8 text-xl font-semibold">4. Third-Party Cookies</h2>
        <p>
          In addition to our own cookies, we may also use various third-party cookies to report usage statistics of the
          website, deliver advertisements on and through the website, and so on.
        </p>
        <p>These may include:</p>
        <ul className="list-disc pl-6">
          <li>
            <strong>Analytics providers</strong> (such as Google Analytics) to help us understand how users interact
            with the website.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Advertising partners</strong> who may use cookies to collect information about your browsing habits
